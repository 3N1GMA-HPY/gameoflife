# Game of Life Board Generator


A simple little game of life generator & tester for COMP1521 Assignment 1


## What can it do?

- Create a randomly generated board to 'nearly' any size you specify (Note its unwise to make very large boards...)

- Compare your mips output to that of the course provided life.c file

- Play the randomly generated board using your mips program

 
To use: compile and run inside the same directory as your prog.s, life.c files.

Note: Don't forget to change your life.c header from "board1.h" to "board.h"
